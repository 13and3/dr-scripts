# dr-scripts
A series of Lich (https://lichproject.org/) scripts for use in DragonRealms (http://www.play.net/dr/).

## combat-trainer.lic and combat-trainer-setup.lic
These scripts train a list of weapon skills, starting with whichever has the lowest amount of field experience.

## crossing-repair.lic and crossing-repair-setup.lic
These scripts repair leather and metal gear in The Crossing.

## crossing-training.lic and crossing-training-setup.lic
These scripts train a list of non-combat skills, starting with whichever has the lowest amount of field experience.

## events.lic
This script is a helper which adds support for Events and Flags to make scripting easier and more robust.

## create_symlinks.bat
Useful if you are doing development on Windows. Change the _Destination variable.

Note: if you use GitHub for Windows and discard changes to a file, the symlink will be broken. Delete the symlink (the "file" in the destination path such as the Lich\scripts directory) and rerun the batch file.

>l shov
You see the initials "S. A." impressed into the surface of the metal.
>anal shovel
You analyze every minute detail of the wide shovel and smile knowingly to yourself.
This appears to be a crafting tool and it is badly damaged.
This tool is used to shovel fuel in a forge, and mine stone, ore and gems.
The workmanship is masterfully-crafted.
Assessing the shovel's durability, you determine it is rather flimsy and easily damaged.
About 8 volume of metal was used in this item's construction.
This tool appears to be extremely effective at increasing crafting speed.
This appears to be the work of someone with the initials "S. A.".
The metal appears to have been slowly tempered to improve its durability.

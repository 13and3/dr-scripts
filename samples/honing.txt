You turn your book to page 1, instructions for crafting metal weapon honing.
>study book
You begin to study the instructions and slowly understand how to hone metal weapons.  Honing uses stock removal with a grinding wheel to reduce the weight of a finished weapon.  Honing can be useful to reduce the weight of a weapon when ore with a reduced density is unavailable.

To hone a weapon you must first get a grindstone spinning fast and then PUSH the grindstone with the weapon.  Occasionally, you will then need to RUB the weapon with a wire brush to smooth any burrs from the stock removal.

Lastly, a coat of oil will have to be POURed onto the metal to protect it.  Be sure to remember that you can Hone, or Balance a weapon - but not both!
You scan the weapon honing instructions with a glance and completely understand all facets of the design.
Despite this, the difficulty will depend primarily on the difficulty of the base item being altered.  The chance of success will depend on the final quality achieved.
You now feel ready to begin the crafting process.

You have no idea how to do that.  Perhaps you should try pushing the grinding wheel with whatever you are trying to grind.
>push grin with sword
You angle the two-handed sword against the wheel and gently cut into the metal.  Back and forth you slide the metal across the stone as sparks fly all about.

The grinding has left many nicks and burs in the metal that should be cleaned away.

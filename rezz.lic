The Resurrection spell is but one of the greatest gifts the Immortals may grant a Cleric.  Once a soul is bonded to its body, this spell will return the body to life.

This is a non-battle spell that can be cast on a single target.  Non-battle spells have significantly longer preparation times than battle spells.  This is a cyclic spell.  To cast this kind of spell, prepare it at the amount of mana you wish to cast it at, and then cast it.  This spell will continually pulse as long as you have harnessed enough mana to fuel the mana requirements.  Cambrinth also works as a source of fuel for cyclic spells, as does your raw attunement if you have the Raw Channeling feat.  It can be cast without a target.  It requires a minimum of five mana streams, and can expand to a maximum of forty mana streams woven into it.  To begin to be able to cast this spell, you will need to reach the rank of a beginning aficionado.  By the time you have mastered this spell, you will be ranked as a venerated master in your abilities as a caster.  It requires the Utility skill to cast effectively.

The spell requires at minimum 5 mana streams and you think you can reinforce it with 4 more, for a total of 9 streams.

Infusion is a magical Cleric ability.  It has several different applications:

   INFUSE INTEGRITY <# of mana> - Fortifies the patterns of the spells on you against dispels.

   INFUSE MEMORY <# of spirit> - Rejuvenates yourself when dead, relying upon spirit energy instead of mana.

Certain spells may also be receptive to direct infusion for some special effects:

The Resurrection spell is but one of the greatest gifts the Immortals may grant a Cleric.  Once a soul is bonded to its body, this spell will return the body to life.

This is a non-battle spell that can be cast on a single target.  Non-battle spells have significantly longer preparation times than battle spells.  This is a cyclic spell.  To cast this kind of spell, prepare it at the amount of mana you wish to cast it at, and then cast it.  This spell will continually pulse as long as you have harnessed enough mana to fuel the mana requirements.  Cambrinth also works as a source of fuel for cyclic spells, as does your raw attunement if you have the Raw Channeling feat.  It can be cast without a target.  It requires a minimum of five mana streams, and can expand to a maximum of forty mana streams woven into it.  To begin to be able to cast this spell, you will need to reach the rank of a beginning aficionado.  By the time you have mastered this spell, you will be ranked as a venerated master in your abilities as a caster.  It requires the Utility skill to cast effectively.

The spell requires at minimum 5 mana streams and you think you can reinforce it with 6 more, for a total of 11 streams.
